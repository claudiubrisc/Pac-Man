# Pac-Man in C#

A **Pac-Man clone** built in **C#** as a learning project for game development and object-oriented programming.
It recreates the classic Pac-Man gameplay with a simple interface, ghosts, pellets, and a score system.

## 🎯 Game Description
You control **Pac-Man** through a maze filled with pellets.  
Your objective is simple:
- Eat all the pellets to clear the level
- Avoid ghosts moving randomly
- Collect points and aim for the highest score

This project demonstrates:
- Basic **game loop** implementation in WPF
- Handling **keyboard input** for movement
- **Collision detection** for Pac-Man, ghosts, and pellets
- Switching **WPF windows** for menus, gameplay, and victory screens


## 🕹 Features
- ✅ Classic maze-style gameplay
- ✅ Keyboard controls (arrow keys)
- ✅ Ghost enemies with basic AI
- ✅ Score tracking system
- ✅ Start/Restart functionality

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **C#** with **.NET Framework 4.6/4.8**  
- **Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)** for UI  
- **XAML** for designing windows (`MainWindow.xaml`, `Victory.xaml`, etc.) 

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Download the latest `.zip` from the repository.
2. Extract the contents.
3. Run the executable:  
   `PacMan_Brisc_Claudiu.exe` (located in the `Pac-Man-main` folder).
4. Use arrow keys to control Pac-Man.

> ⚠ No installation required. This game runs as a standalone `.exe`.

## 🕹️ Gameplay Rules
- **Arrow Keys** → Move Pac-Man  
- Eat all pellets to **win**  
- Ghosts move randomly – touching them **ends the game**  
- Score increases for each pellet eaten  
- Victory screen appears after clearing the level  

## 📖 Learning Goals
This project is designed for educational purposes, helping you learn:
- How to structure a simple WPF game
- Handling keyboard events in C#
- Collision detection & basic game logic
- Window navigation between menus and game scenes
